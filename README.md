## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Senior Mobile Application Developer** with **6–7 years of hands-on experience in Android development**, building scalable, high-performance applications used in production.

My core expertise lies in **Android (Kotlin & Java)**, where I have worked extensively with clean architecture, performance optimization, and complex business logic.  
Alongside Android, I also have **strong experience in native iOS (Swift)** and have delivered multiple **Flutter-based cross-platform applications**.

Currently, I work at **Aquil Media (Nashik)**, contributing to end-to-end mobile app development — from requirement analysis and architecture to deployment and maintenance.
